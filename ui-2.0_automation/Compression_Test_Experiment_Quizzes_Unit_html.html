<p> <b>Q1.</b>                Compression tests are generally performed on brittles materials-why?                 <br/><br/> <b>Q2.</b>                Which will have a higher strength: a small specimen or a full size member made of the same material?                <br/><br/> <b>Q3.</b>                What is column action? How does the h/d ratio of specimen affect the test result? <br/><br/> <b>Q4.</b>                How do ductile and brittle materials differ in their behavior in compression test?                 <br/><br/> <b>Q5.</b>                What are bi-modulus materials? Give examples.                <br/><br/> <b>Q6.</b>                In cylindrical specimen, it is essential to keep h/d <br/> </p> <p> <a href="Exp-2 Compression test.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
