<p> 	      Procedure for the experiment is as follows. 	    </p> <p align="justify"> 1. Dimensions of test piece is measured at 3 different places along its height/length to determine the average c/s area.<br/> 2. Ends of the specimen should be plane. For that the ends are tested on a bearing plate.<br/> 3. The specimen is placed centrally between the two compression plates, such that the center of moving head is vertically above the center of specimen.<br/> 4. Load is applied on the specimen by moving the movable head.<br/> 5. The load and the corresponding contraction are measured at different intervals. The load interval may be as 500kg.<br/> 6. Load is applied until the specimen fails. </p> <p> <a href="Exp-2 Compression test.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>
