<p align="justify">             A compression test is a method for determining the behavior of materials under a compressive load. Compression tests are conducted by loading the test specimen between two plates and then applying a force to the specimen by moving the crossheads together. The compression test is used to determine elastic limit, proportionality limit, yield point, yield strength and compressive strength.             </p> <p align="justify"> <strong>Compressive Strength :-</strong> It is the maximum compressive stress that a material is capable of withstanding without fracture. Brittle materials fracture during testing and have a definite compressive strength values. The compressive strength of ductile materials is determined by their degree of distortion during testing.             </p> <p> <a href="Exp-2 Compression test.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>
